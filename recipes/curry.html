            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste <em>(optional)</em></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>8 ounces russet or yukon gold potato</li>
            <li>8 ounces carrots <em>(cut into 3/4 inch or 2 cm triangular pieces; about 3 medium carrots)</em></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch <em>(mixed onto a slurry with 1 tablespoon water)</em></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the Chicken Katsu:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
            <li> 1 egg</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>vegetable oil <em>(for frying)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>For Serving:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups steamed short grain Japanese rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a Dutch oven or other medium to large pot over medium heat. Add the 1 tablespoon oil and the onion, and cook until the onions begin to turn translucent and the edges begin to brown, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, tomato paste, and Worcestershire sauce (if using), and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Then stir in the curry powder, salt, and sugar, and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in the potatoes, carrots, and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until the potatoes and carrots are tender, about 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, butterfly the chicken breast so they’re thin and even. If the chicken is uneven, you can pound it to an even thickness. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel. Season both sides of the chicken pieces with salt and pepper, and dust with a light, even coating of flour. In one shallow bowl, beat the egg. Put the panko breadcrumbs into another shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Add a thin, even layer of oil to a cast iron pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat. The oil is ready when you throw a panko breadcrumb into the oil and it sizzles. Dip the chicken into the egg to coat. Transfer to the panko and press it evenly into the chicken to get a good coating.</li>
            <li>You’ll need to cook the chicken in a couple batches. Carefully lay the chicken in the hot oil and cook for 6 minutes on one side, until golden brown. Flip and cook the other side for another 5-6 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining chicken, adding oil to the pan as needed.</li>
            <li>Stir the cornstarch with the water to make a slurry, and add it to the curry sauce. Stir until the sauce is thickened, then stir in the butter. Taste for seasoning and add additional salt to taste if needed.</li>
            <li>Slice the chicken, and place over the steamed rice. Ladle the curry sauce on the side. Enjoy!</li>
