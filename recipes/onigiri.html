        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups sushi rice cooked</li>
            <li>50 grams rice seasoning aka furikake</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>nori sheets cut into small rectangles</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pop your cooked sushi rice into a large mixing bowl. Add the furikake rice seasoning and mix through evenly. Note: if you feel like hiding something tasty inside instead, you can skip this step.</li>
            <li>Separate the rice into equal portions, approximately one large handful for each onigiri.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.</li>
            <li>Pick up one handful/portion of rice. If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.</li>
            <li>Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so itâ€™s even. According to our Japanese friends, you want to end up with one face of the onigiri having a small indentation from your fingers.</li>
            <li>Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri, rough side in towards the rice. Then fold it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.</li>
            <li>Repeat for the remaining rice portions.</li>
        </ol>
